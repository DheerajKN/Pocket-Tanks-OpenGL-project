### Introduction
This Project is done as a basis of our Knowledge on the subject of Computer Graphics using C++ and OpenGLframework. 
In this Project we are implementing the same old properties that you could see while playing the PocketTanks Game.

### Installation
```bash
sudo apt-get install freeglut3 freeglut3-dev mesa-common-dev 
```
### Compiling and Linking
```bash
We can use gcc/g++ to compile a program with glut library.

g++ file.cpp -lglut -lGLU -lGL  or   gcc file.c -lglut -lGLU -lGL
```
### Game Features
* It basically is a 2-Player Feature 
* Each User has a chance to destory his Opponent and one does it early Winner
  * After hitting the Start Button
  * User has the Option to change the Angle and Fire Power using those he can strategically throw Ammution on the Opponent and the near Proximity of the Weapon Impact would generate the level of Health Deduction.
  * Thus when health reaches 0 or Negative then his Opponent Wins the Game!!
